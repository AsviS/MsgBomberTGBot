<h1 align="center">MsgBomberTGBot Telegram Bot - v1.0</h1>
<p align="center">An open-source SMS bomber bot for Telegram. Inspired by TheSpeedX's Project</p><br>

## Note:

- The script requires working network connection to work.
- No balance will be deducted for using this script to send SMS/calls.
- While doing infinite bombing use 2-3 seconds delay and 10 to 20 threads for maximum performance.
- Don't put spaces in between phone number (Ex- 99999 99999)
- Make sure you are using Python v3.

Here's how you can check it. Type this command in your terminal.
```
$ python -V
```
If output looks like `Python 3` - Congrats, Python 3 is installed properly.

- Do not use this to harm others.
- This script is only for educational purposes or to prank.
